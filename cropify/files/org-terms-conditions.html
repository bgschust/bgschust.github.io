  <h2>Organization Terms & Conditions</h2>

  <h3>Sales Tax</h3>
  <p>Please include sales tax in the price of your items.</p>

  <h3>Fulfilling Customer Orders</h3>
  <h4>Self Pick-Up</h4>
  <p>Please place the orders in grocery bags prior to your customers' pick-up hours.</p>
  <h4>Delivery</h4>
  <p>Not yet offered.</p>

  <h3>Payments</h3>
  <h4>Payment Methods</h4>
  <h5>Pay at Pick-Up (USD)</h5>
  <p>The default payment method is for customers to pay at pick-up in U.S. dollars. Be sure to collect this payment when the customer picks up their order.</p>
  <h4>Currency Considerations</h4>
  <h5>Calculated Pricing</h5>
  <p>The USD prices on your market items update when you set AgG prices on the sell-item page. Press enter in the "Price (AgG)" numeric input box to see the "Price (USD)" locked input change. The USD price will update again when it is re-calculated for a customer at checkout, and this price is shown in their order history and your sale history.</p>
  <h5>Exchange Rates</h5>
  <p>Exchange rates between USD and AgG are found by taking the lowest bulk price for transaction tokens on a USD per AgG basis.</p>
